# cheat
This is a repository of little cheat sheets, mainly from my own research/work. The main script 'cheat' must be placed in your $PATH and then you can run the command like so:

 cheat KEYWORD

The script will scan the directory with the cheat sheets and look for those keywords in the first line, which starts with ^#. If it matches, it will print out that file, where I have stored my notes on a particular topic. Simple cheat sheet for command line use.
