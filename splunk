##splunk query index lookup 

#Lookups - Append this to any search to match against list
#Match from Lookup:
[ inputlookup something.csv |field FIELD_FROM_LOOKUP_FILE |rename FIELD_FROM_LOOKUP_FILE as FIELD_TO_MATCH ]
#Match everything BUT fields from lookup:
NOT [ inputlookup something.csv |field FIELD_FROM_LOOKUP_FILE |rename FIELD_FROM_LOOKUP_FILE as FIELD_TO_MATCH ]
#Match one field from lookup and then match another field on another column from lookup:
[ inputlookup something.csv |field FIELD1_FROM_LOOKUP_FILE |rename FIELD1_FROM_LOOKUP_FILE as FIELD1_TO_MATCH ] |search [ inputlookup something.csv |field FIELD2_FROM_LOOKUP_FILE |rename FIELD2_FROM_LOOKUP_FILE as FIELD2_TO_MATCH ]

#On-the-Fly Lookups based on other data:
index=BLAH KEYWORD NOT [|search index=BLAH sourcetype=BLAH earliest=-2d |top host by whatever |fields host] |top something

#Eval - rename based on event type
|eval NEW_FIELD=case(EXISTING_FIELD, "Content to display") |top NEW_FIELD
Example (will print a table of action name and ID):
|eval MS_Action=case(EventCode=4624, "User Login") |top MS_Action by EventCode
#Eval Multi-Value in same field (Selects the second value in the field below)
|eval User_Account=mvindex(Account_Name,1) |search User_Account="superman"

#Windows Firewall outbound traffic to non-USA
index=windowsindex EventCode=5156 Direction=Outbound |iplocation Destination_Address |search NOT Country="United States"

#CIDR - Splunk supports by default:
index=firewalls destination_ip!=192.168.0.0/16
index=firewalls NOT [inputlookup internal_cidr.csv |fields cidr |rename cidr as destination_ip]
