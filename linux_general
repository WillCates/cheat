#LINUX PRIVILEGE ESCALATION

#COMMON TECHNIQUES:
1. Kernel exploits
2. Exploiting services which are running as root (udev,samba,mysql,etc.)
3. Exploiting SUID Executables (nmap drop shell)
4. Exploiting SUDO rights/user (sudo -l)
5. Exploiting badly configured cron jobs (check for world write: /etc/cron*, /var/spool/cron/*)
6. Exploiting users with ‘.’ in their PATH (trick user into getting CWD where there is fake binary located to exec)
7. Find stuff laying around (backups, bash_history, passwords, SSH Keys)
