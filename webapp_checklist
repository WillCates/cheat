#webapp checklist strategy

 - Try to determine the frameworks supported (ASP, ASPX, PHP)
 - Enumerate a base list with dirb or dirbuster, plus a list with the supported framework extension
 - Run nikto on the webapp
 - Try default credentials on all authentication portals
 - Check for erroneous comments in the source of the pages
 - Determine version or year that the webapp was created
 - Look for public exploits for that version/year and webapp
 - Run SQLMap against any GET related inputs
 - Save a Burp Request and run SQLMap against login POST form and other POST forms
